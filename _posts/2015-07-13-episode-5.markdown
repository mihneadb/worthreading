A few words on why go's simplicity makes it [a great fit for open source](https://texlution.com/post/why-go-is-doomed-to-succeed/?imm_mid=0d3d37&cmp=em-prog-na-na-newsltr_20150620).

[Why humans rule the world](http://ideas.ted.com/why-humans-run-the-world/) - how cooperation and the perception of value make us different.

Check out this crazy cool [tech demo](http://blog.leapmotion.com/touch-things-make-everything-interactive/?utm_source=Leap+Motion+Newsletter&utm_campaign=6af2d6b379-Newsletter_120A&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_f0a6fbd89e-6af2d6b379-63808929) using Leap Motion.

The Verge has a nice [collection](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/4/8890173/1776-times-american-aircraft-did-something-completely-badass) on American aircrafts. The [SR 71](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpVT5Lr0BbI) clip is the most badass.

Leaving aircrafts aside, here's an astonishing comparison between the Titanic and a modern cruise ship. Wow! [link](https://twitter.com/kathy_blake93/status/618057476555034624?autoplay=true)
