First off, a great [website](http://aaron-meyers.com/!/), showing off what you can do with WebGL.

Speaking of the Web, it seems that the big players have agreed on a common `asm.js`, called [web assembly](https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/).

Best explanation of what map reduce is - [link](https://twitter.com/tgrall/status/520810627867348992).

Jeff Atwood is [funny as usual](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/608913159487934464).

The up and coming *No Man's Sky* game looks [really interesting](http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/19/minecraft-grand-theft-auto-no-mans-sky-e3/). And its developer is [funny as well](https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/598622099205451777).

Google opened up about [diversity](http://www.google.com/diversity/).

I didn't know Youtube was such a great source of money. Read more [here](http://www.quora.com/How-much-do-YouTubers-make-when-each-of-their-videos-get-50k-100k-500k-1m-and-1-5m-views/answer/George-Chalhoub-1?srid=3unQ&share=1).

Quora has a great [list of tech talks](http://www.quora.com/What-tech-talks-should-every-software-engineer-watch/answer/Yad-Faeq?srid=3unQ&share=1) "every software engineer should see".

Facebook's new *Moments* app raises [privacy concerns](http://fortune.com/2015/06/17/facebook-moments-privacy-facial-recognition/).

Speaking about privacy - crazy what you can do with someone else's GoPro after [bruteforcing its password](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32934083). And it [turns out](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/18/research-shows-how-macbook-webcams-can-spy-on-their-users-without-warning/) macs are also vulnerable.
