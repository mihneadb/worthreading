I found out there's a pattern matching library for C++. Pretty cool! https://github.com/solodon4/Mach7

Turns out SSDs [lose data when left without power](http://www.zdnet.com/article/solid-state-disks-lose-data-if-left-without-power-for-just-a-few-days/).

There's really interesting movement within the Go community. I've read the slides of two Go talks that have popped up online recently. [Go in go](http://talks.golang.org/2015/gogo.slide) talks about the process of removing the C bits from the Go compiler. [Stage of Go](http://talks.golang.org/2015/state-of-go-may.slide#1) is more general, giving an overview of the Go ecosystem today.

A Quora digest surfaced one of the best examples of software bugs that turned into features. Check it out [here](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-examples-of-software-bugs-that-became-features-a-k-a-misbugs/answer/Mac-Tan?srid=3unQ&share=1).

Someone took on a webdev project in Rust and wrote some [thoughts on it](http://blog.viraptor.info/post/i-wrote-a-website-in-rust-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale).

Speaking of Rust, there's a hilarious comment on HN on dependency management and *something else*. [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/f2pNciL.png) and [link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9631283).

Another funny find: a video of a 350Z trying to race a 911. Check out what happens: https://twitter.com/crashingtv/status/604249781590986752

Finally, it's funny how licenses and contracts work. It seems Beyonce has to pay Sony for permission to stream her *own* songs on her *own* music streaming service. [Link here](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/05/beyonce-leaving-tidal-jay-z-sony).
